# Vulkan + Swift

This library contains Swift bindings for Vulkan that are largely generated.

You can find a demo application here: [SwiftVulkanDemo](https://github.com/UnGast/SwiftVulkanDemo).

There are still some types and functions for which there is no binding. I'm adding as I need them for my projects.

Documentation will be written later. If you have question or problems just open an issue.

The general approach and a good amount of bindings have been taken from: [alexanderuv/vulkanSwift](https://github.com/alexanderuv/vulkanSwift).
